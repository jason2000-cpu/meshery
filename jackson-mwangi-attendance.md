# Brief Introduction
I’m a purpose-driven Software Engineer passionate about building human-centered and impactful technology. I combine creativity 
with analytical thinking to design solutions that not only work efficiently but also make a genuine difference in people’s lives. 
My approach to development is rooted in curiosity, empathy, and a deep belief that technology should empower, not overwhelm.

With experience across full-stack development, AI, and product design, I enjoy transforming complex problems into intuitive, 
scalable systems. I’m most fulfilled when working on projects that align with strong values, whether that means advancing 
sustainability, improving digital access, or creating tools that promote growth and connection.
